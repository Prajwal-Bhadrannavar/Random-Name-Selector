# Random-Name-Selector

In this mini-project,I created a program which selects a random name from an array of input names.
I used Javascript.
Imagine a situation when you are out with your friends and you guys fight on who is going to pay the bill. No worries, I got you covered. By using my program you can input your friends name in the form of an array and it will return a LUCKY person's name.
